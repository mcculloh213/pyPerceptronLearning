# DataSetI:   (!x1 && !x2) || (x1 && !x2)
# DataSetII:  (x1 && x2) || (x1 && x3) || (x2 && x3)
# DataSetIII: !x1 && (x2 ^ x3) || x1 && (!x2 && !x3 || x2 && x3)
# DataSetIV:  x1 ^ x2 -- XOR

The perceptron was able to converge on all weights, however it was not able to learn the rule for data sets III and IV.
This is because the logic functions for data sets III and IV contain an XOR between two variables, which a single neuron
cannot learn a rule for.
